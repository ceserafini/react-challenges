# Pixel Art

### Dificulty
:star: :star: :star: :star:

### Challenge
Build a pixel art drawing app

**React Context** to allows you to share data between components more easily. Intead of having to pass a prop down multiple levels, you can use context 

### Notes
- Directory ```08-pixel-art``` has starter code
- Four react components written for you that render a grid and colors

### Requirements
- When a color is clicked, that color becomes the drawing color. Then, when one of the grid squares is clicked, it should be colored in with the drawing color
- Use React Context tho share state between you components
