# Simple Calculator

### Dificulty
:star: :star: :star: :star:

**useReducer** Sometimes states becomes complicated in React, and there are multiples mutations you will need to implement on your data. useReducer helps simplify this by moving state management outside of the component.

### Challenge
Build a simple calculator

### Notes
- Directory ```09-simple-calculator``` has starter code
- Limited calculator UI pre-built where you can choose two numbers and an action to take

### Requirements
- Implement the logic so that two numbers can be selected
- Implement the logic to add these selected numbers together. Same for substraction
- Implement a clear function which will reset both the number to 0
- Use useReducer to store and modify you data
