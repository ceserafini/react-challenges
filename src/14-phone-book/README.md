# Phone Book


### Dificulty
:star: :star: :star:

### Challenge
Create a simple form at he top that allows the user enter in a first name, last name, and phone number and there should be a submit button. Once the submit button is pressed, the information should be displayed in a list below (automatically sorted by last name) along with all the previous information that was entered. This way the application can function as a simple phone book. When your application loads, the inputs fields (not the phone book list) should be prepopulated with the following values already:
```
Fisrt name = Byte
Last Name = Coder
Phone = 8885559999
```

### Notes
- Directory ```14-phone-book``` has starter code
