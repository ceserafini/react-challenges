# Dark Mode Toggle

### Dificulty
:star:

### Challenge
Implement a component that allows you to change from light to dark mode and back again

### Notes
- Directory ```02-dark-mode``` has starter code 
- CSS class dark-mode in the index.css file that, when added to an element, changes its background colo to dark grey
- The div with the className .page takes up whole screen - add the dark-mode class to this element

### Requirements
- When the button with the className dar-mode-button is clicked, the page should be displayed in the dark mode
- When the button with the className light-mode-button is clicked, the page should be displayed without dark mode
