# React Color Render

### Dificulty
:star:

### Challenge
Create a color picking app so the user can select the page's background color

### Notes
- Directory ```07-color-picker``` has starter code
- Similar to challenge 1


### Requirements
- Upon clicking a color, change the whole page's background to be that color
- Make sure to use the Color subcomponent
