# React Color Render

### Dificulty
:star:

### Challenge
In React you will often need to pass data from one component to other and create multiple instances of a component with different information displayed in each instance.
Build a color render that will display color swatches on a user interface.

### Notes
- Directory ```01-color-renderer``` has starter code
- Two components, Color and ColorRender
- Array of colors with hex codes and names

### Requirements
Update the ColorRender component to display one instance of the Color component for each color in the array of colors.
