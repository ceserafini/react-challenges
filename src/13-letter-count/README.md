# Letter Count


### Dificulty
:star: :star: :star:

### Challenge
Have the function LetterCount(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces.

Examples
- Input: "Hello apple pie"
- Output: Hello
- Input: "No words"
- Output: -1 


### Notes
- Directory ```12-letter-count``` has starter code

### Requirements
- Implement the logic to return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters
- If there are no words with repeating letters return -1
