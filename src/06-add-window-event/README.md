### Challenge
Add and remove effects whithin React.

### Notes
- Directory ```06-add-widow-event``` that has started code
- Button that toggles mounting of a child component, WidowEvent
- Starter UI which displays a score that can be increased or decreased

### Requirements
- When the WindowEvent component is active, add an event listener to the window that triggers an alert if the user double clicks on the page
-Make sure to remove the windows event when the component is toggled off
