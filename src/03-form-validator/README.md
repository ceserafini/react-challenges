:star: :star: :star:

### Challenge
A very commont task that developers has to perform is to make sure that a form validates. Meaning that the user has inputted correct information that fits certain conditions into a form. Validate a use sign-up form once the user submits that form.

### Notes
- Directory ```03-form-validator``` that has started code
- React form already-created with three fields, email, pasword and password-confirm

### Requirements
Validate the form is submited, validate that the user's information fits the following requirements:
- The email, password and password confirmation fields are filled in
- The email field hace exactly one @ sign in it
- The password must be eight or more characters long
- The password and the password confirmation must be the same
If any of this conditions aren't met, display an error; if they are all met display a success message
