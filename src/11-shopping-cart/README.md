:star: :star: :star: :star:

### Challenge
Build a shopping cart that displays total price when adding items

### Notes
- Directory ```11-shopping-cart``` has starter code
- UI built with items listed on the left, and a cart implemented on the right

- Implement the Add to Cart logic, add an item to the cart when the button is clicked
- Implement the + and - buttons so that you can add or remove items from the cart
- implement the total sum at the bottom of the page
